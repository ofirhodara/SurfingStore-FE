                    A surfboard is a narrow plank used in surfing. Surfboards are relatively light,         but are strong enough to support an individual standing on them while riding an         ocean wave. They were invented in ancient Hawaii, where they were known as papa         he'e nalu in the Hawaiian language, they were usually made of wood from local       trees, such as koa, and were often over 460 cm (15 ft) in length and extremely      heavy.
